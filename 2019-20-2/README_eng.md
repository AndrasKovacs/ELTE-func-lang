  + Students have to register here with the same account and password which
    is used for lab computers.

#### Infrastructure

- Compiler: [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) or
  [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) recommended.  For
  text editing, any editor is fine alongside GHCI.

#### Prerequisites

It is required to know the content of the BSc "functional programming" course,
or equivalent prior knowledge. It is recommended to review the [kezdő
Haskell](http://lambda.inf.elte.hu/Index.xml) notes.


#### Requirements

- Tutorial attendance is mandatory, with max 3 absences.
- Lecture attendance is recommended but *not* mandatory.
- The course grade is given by an exam in the examination period. Usage of any
  material/internet is permitted on the exam. Communication/collaboration
  with exam takers or third parties is not permitted. The exam is ca. 2 hours and
  consists of computer exercises.
- The prerequisite of exam taking is the fulfillment of tutorial (practice)
  requirements.
- Practice requirements:
  + There is 10 minute BEAD assignment at the start of each practice, except the
    first one. 0, 1 or 2 points are awarded for each.
  + Three larger homework assignments will be created, each is worth 4 points.
  + Min. 13 practice points have to be acquired during the semester.

#### Curriculum

- Algebraic datatypes
- Type classes
- Basic classes: Eq, Ord, Show
- Semigroup, Monoid
- Functor, Foldable
- Monad, specific monads: Reader, State, Maybe, list, IO
- Applicative, Traversable
- Parser monad
- Monad transformers
- Parsers and interpreters for simple languages

#### Materials

- Course materials and exercises are uploaded to this repository. Tutorial
  materials go to "gyak_X" folders, where "X" denotes the group code wihch can
  be found in neptun.
- Recommended literature: http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters,
